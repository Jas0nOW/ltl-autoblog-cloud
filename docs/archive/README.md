# Docs Archive

`docs/archive/` contains historical material that is useful for context but should not clutter day-to-day documentation.

What belongs here:
- Sprint plans / next steps
- One-off investigations and long analyses
- Older closeout reports

If a document becomes “current truth”, move it out of the archive into the proper top-level category (reference/product/billing/engineering/ops/testing/workflow).
