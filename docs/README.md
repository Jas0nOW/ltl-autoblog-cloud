# Documentation

This folder is intentionally structured to keep the repo professional and easy to navigate.

## Start here
- Product onboarding: `docs/product/onboarding.md`
- Architecture overview: `docs/reference/architecture.md`
- API contract (Portal ↔ Make): `docs/reference/api.md`
- Release process: `docs/releases/release-checklist.md`

## Structure
- `docs/reference/` — core reference docs (API, architecture)
- `docs/product/` — customer-facing product docs (onboarding, plans)
- `docs/billing/` — billing/webhook docs (Gumroad)
- `docs/engineering/` — implementation notes and Make.com engine contracts
- `docs/ops/` — operational notes (SSL/proxy)
- `docs/testing/` — smoke tests and test logs
- `docs/workflow/` — how we work (issue workflow, closeout, VS Code workflow)
- `docs/marketing/` — landing page copy + publishing steps

## Rules (keep it clean)
- Prefer *updating* an existing doc over creating a new one.
- Avoid one-off sprint notes, scratchpads, and AI prompt packs in the repo.
